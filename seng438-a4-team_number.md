# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
Initially, we started  by identifying the different use-case scenarios , for Amazon.ca, that needed to be tested. Then we proceeded to define the test case scenarios by defining the tests that needed to be executed and the steps that needed to be implemented. We formed a step-by-step routine of the tests so that it can be efficiently performed once we started recording them. We also created example test data such as the category of the product that needs to be selected or item that needs to be searched using the search bar. We then proceeded to set up the Selenium IDE and added it as an extension to our Chrome web browser. Using the test cases and example test data we performed our tests on the Amazon.ca website and recorded our scripts by using HTML tags, in order to write the steps that the user would require to fulfill the outcomes of the user-case scenario. While doing this , we closely looked at any unpredictable results and tried to manually fix them by adding our own test script. We also added several validation checkpoints in order to check that the tests are getting the required outcomes. After the test scripts were written, we executed each one of them in order to identify any discrepancies in the outcomes and how we can make the tests better. 


# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
